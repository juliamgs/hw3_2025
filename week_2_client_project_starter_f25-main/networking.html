      <h2>Networking and Professional Connections</h2>
      <p>
       Networking is about building relationships and getting to know people in positions and career areas of interest.  It has always been an important job/internship strategy. Networking conversations can happen in-person, over the phone, or online through platforms like Zoom.

      <h2>Networking is Building Relationships</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Leverage</strong> your circle of friends, family, professors, previous employers, and the University of Michigan Alumni.</li>
        <li><strong>Be curious</strong> about the person you are connecting with to learn more about their career. Networking isn’t about winning people over or asking for a job. </li>
        <li>We recommend asking for informational interviews, which are short meetings or calls with someone in a field of interest to learn more about their job, their industry, their career pathway, and to hear their advice. </li>
      </ul>
